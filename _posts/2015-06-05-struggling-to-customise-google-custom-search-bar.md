# <a href="https://cse.google.com/cse/" >What is Google CSE ?</a>

> It is a custom search engine that can be integrated into any site that is programmed to search only a set of web resources.

The owner of the Custom search engine can choose to include the required sites that he wants his visitors to view in the search results.

It is actually an amazing tool that helps in quick site wide seach especially to those with limited resources who can't implement a local search tool. Instead copy paste a few lines of code and voila, you have your own search tool.

# So what is so annoying about it ?

But inspite of all these, a major flaw is the lack of customisation offered. Only the colors of the search bar and the results view, etc is being provided. But even to make a small change like reduce the size of the search bar, reduce the margin width around the seach, etc are almost impossible to accomplish. I have been scouring the web for hours on end and even though many claim to have a solution, they all seem to end up achieving nothing.

# So, Have you found a solution ?

Actually, NO. I tried for nearly a day to do it. Even took a small peak at all the .css files related to the CSE and tried to alter it to match my needs but couldn't really get any agreeable result.

It is really disappointing that a company like Google doesn't seem to have found a solution when many for years have been complaining about this aspect of the Google CSE.

# So what now ?

Now ? Well, now, I can only wait for Google to extend their range of customisation options or for some other geek out there to find a solution to this annoying little problem that is preventing the CSE from being the amazing tool it can be. Who knows, maybe you might be that geek.
