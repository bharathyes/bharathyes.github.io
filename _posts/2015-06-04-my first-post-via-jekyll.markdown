With easy access to the latest technology and learning material, the tech world has become highly competitve. In the age of Internet it is important to have a strong online presence. 

In an effort to improve mine to better my prospects and also out of passion for learning new technologies I am on a mission to find a good tool that is simple but also packs a lot of powerful features that could show case my talent and achievements.

Since I am a software engineer, I decided on the largest collection of code, [GitHub][github]. After browsing through a lot of options, I finally settled on [Jekyll][jekyll].

So, currently on the effort of creating a simple, modern, intuitive website that uses minimal resource but packs enough punch to make heads turn in my direction, I am writing my first post here on GitHub Pages via Jekyll.

Assuring more updates on this site, this is Bharath Srinivasan, signing off.
